          Bruno Mars is the stage name of Peter Gene Hernandez. He was born on October 8, 1985, in Honolulu, Hawaii. His mother sang, while his father played the drums in Latin music. Due to his likeness to professional wrestler Bruno Sammartino, he was given the moniker "Bruno" by his father when he was just two years old. Peter, one of six children, was raised in a musical household where he was exposed to a wide range of musical styles, most notably rock and roll, later reggae, hip hop, and rhythm and blues. He performed in a group called The School Boys while he was a student at President Theodore Roosevelt High School in Honolulu. The School Boys opened for his father's new band on several occasions and covered songs by the Isley Brothers and the Temptations. He rose to fame in Hawaiian entertainment while still in high school by portraying Michael Jackson in a celebrity impersonators show and landing the opening slot for a massive magic show, earning $75 for each performance. He chose to add "Mars" to the end of the childhood moniker his father gave him to use as his stage name since he felt lacking in charisma and because many girls thought he was extraterrestrial.

  <h3>Career</h3>
    <div class="music">
      <p> Bruno Mars began his music career by writing songs for other artists, like Flo Rida and Adam Levine, before releasing his debut album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, in 2010. The album had hit singles such as "Just the Way You Are" and "Grenade", which are two of the most successful digital singles of all time with sales of 12.5 million and 10.2 million, respectively. This helped make Mars the biggest selling artist of 2012. He's also the first male artist to sell over 4 million digital copies of four of his songs as a lead singer. Six of his singles are among the best-selling singles of all time.</p>
      <p>Since then, Mars has released several other successful albums, including Unorthodox Jukebox and 24K Magic. He has sold 26 million albums worldwide as of 2016 and a total of 200 million singles as of 2020. In 2022, he became the first artist to receive six diamond certified songs in the United States. Mars has received many awards and honors, including 15 Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, and four Guinness World Records, as well as 11 American and 14 Soul Train Music Awards. In 2011, he was named on Time magazine's 100 list and his former songwriting and record producing team, the Smeezingtons, also received accolades. Currently, he is working on his fourth solo studio album.</p>
